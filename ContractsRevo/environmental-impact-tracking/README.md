# Environmental Impact Tracking Contract

## 🎯 Overview
The Environmental Impact Tracking Contract is a smart contract built on the Soroban framework for the Stellar blockchain. It enables the tracking, verification, and retirement of carbon credits for agricultural projects. This contract provides a transparent and immutable record of environmental impact, allowing farmers to quantify and monetize their sustainable practices while enabling consumers and businesses to offset their carbon footprint.

## 📜 Features
- Carbon credit issuance with verification methods
- Project-based credit tracking and management
- Credit retirement functionality for carbon offsetting
- Comprehensive reporting on environmental impact
- Transparent verification of sustainability claims
- Immutable record of carbon credit lifecycle
- Project-specific credit listing and tracking

## 🛠 Contract Functionality
### **1. Carbon Credit Management**
The contract allows authorized entities to:
- Issue new carbon credits with unique identifiers
- Specify carbon amounts in kilograms
- Document verification methods used
- Track issuance dates automatically
- Validate all parameters before credit creation
- Associate credits with specific agricultural projects
- List all credits by project identifier

### **2. Credit Retirement**
Users can retire carbon credits to offset emissions:
- Mark credits as retired by specific addresses
- Verify credit availability before retirement
- Prevent double-retirement of credits
- Track retirement status of all credits
- Query retirement status for verification
- Update retirement status through administrative functions

### **3. Verification and Reporting**
The contract provides functionality to:
- Verify the authenticity of carbon credits
- Generate reports on environmental impact
- Track the lifecycle of carbon credits
- Provide transparent verification of sustainability claims
- Support environmental impact assessments

## 🚀 Setup Guide
### **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Rust & Cargo
- Soroban CLI
- Stellar Standalone/Testnet/Mainnet access
- Node.js (for interacting with the contract via scripts)

### **Installation Steps**
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Crypto-Jaguars/Revo-Contracts.git
   cd ContractsRevo/environmental-impact-tracking
   ```
2. **Build the Contract**
   ```bash
   stellar contract build
   ```
3. **Run the Tests**
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

## 📊 Data Structures
### **CarbonCredit**
Represents a carbon credit with the following properties:
- Project ID: Unique identifier for the agricultural project
- Carbon Amount: Quantity of carbon offset in kilograms
- Verification Method: Method used to verify the carbon offset
- Issuance Date: Timestamp when the credit was issued
- Retirement Status: Current status (Available or Retired)

### **RetirementStatus**
Enum representing the possible states of a carbon credit:
- Available: Credit is active and can be retired
- Retired(Address): Credit has been retired by the specified address

## 📌 Best Practices
- Ensure proper validation of all parameters before issuing credits
- Verify credit existence and status before retirement
- Use unique identifiers for projects and credits
- Implement proper error handling for all operations
- Track all credit lifecycle events through event emissions
- Maintain accurate metadata for all carbon credits
- Regularly audit credit issuance and retirement

## 📖 Error Handling
The contract includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Credit operations (not found, already exists)
- Parameter validation (zero amount, invalid amount)
- Identifier validation (invalid project or credit IDs)
- Verification method validation (empty methods)
- Retirement operations (already retired)

## 🔄 Contract Interactions
### **For Credit Issuers**
1. Issue new carbon credits for agricultural projects
2. Specify verification methods and carbon amounts
3. Track credits associated with specific projects
4. Generate reports on environmental impact

### **For Credit Users**
1. Retire carbon credits to offset emissions
2. Verify credit authenticity and status
3. Track retirement history
4. Access environmental impact data

## 🌐 Use Cases
- Carbon offsetting for agricultural operations
- Sustainable farming practice verification
- Environmental impact reporting for supply chains
- Carbon credit trading for agricultural projects
- Sustainability certification for agricultural products
- Corporate environmental responsibility programs
- Consumer-facing carbon footprint offsetting

## Data Structures

### LoanRequest
```rust
struct LoanRequest {
    id: u32,
    borrower: Address,
    amount: i128,
    purpose: String,
    duration_days: u32,
    interest_rate: u32,  // basis points
    collateral: CollateralInfo,

struct CollateralInfo {
    asset_type: String,  // "Savings", "Future harvest", "Equipment"
    estimated_value: i128,
    verification_data: BytesN<32>,  // Hash of verification documents
}
```

### LoanStatus
```rust
enum LoanStatus {
    Pending,   // Created but not fully funded
    Funded,    // Fully funded, not yet repaid

let loan_id = contract.create_loan_request(
    borrower_address,
    10000,  // 10,000 tokens
    "Agricultural equipment purchase".into(),
    90,     // 90 days
    1500,   // 15% interest (1500 basis points)
    CollateralInfo {
